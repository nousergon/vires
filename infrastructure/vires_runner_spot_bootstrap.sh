# infrastructure/vires_runner_spot_bootstrap.sh — provision an EC2-spot box,
# register it as an EPHEMERAL GitHub Actions self-hosted runner for
# nousergon/vires, let it pick up exactly ONE queued job, then
# self-terminate. alpha-engine-config-I2572 (source design).
#
# SIBLING of ci_watch_spot_bootstrap.sh/sf_watch_spot_bootstrap.sh — mirrors
# their proven skeleton VERBATIM for the watchdog/deferred-shutdown mechanics
# (see ci_watch_spot_bootstrap.sh's header for the full config#1472 incident
# history behind that piece). DIFFERENT WORKLOAD, though: those two run a
# bespoke Claude Code agent over SSM outside the GHA Actions protocol; this
# one runs the actual `actions-runner` binary and lets GitHub's own Actions
# service dispatch the already-queued job to it — the workflow YAML (checkout,
# setup-python, pytest, etc.) is untouched, only `runs-on:` changes. See
# alpha-engine-config-I2572 (source design) for the full rationale (why self-hosted, why
# ephemeral-spot over a persistent box).
#
# Invoked by the `vires-runner-dispatcher` Lambda over SSM. That
# Lambda is triggered by a GitHub `workflow_job` (action=queued) webhook —
# NOT by a thin GHA-hosted job like ci-watch/sf-watch's dispatch legs, since
# the whole point here is a workflow with ZERO GHA-hosted involvement. The
# Lambda's send-command prelude fetches the PAT, clones this repo, then
# `exec`s THIS script from the repo root — same shape as ci-watch/groom.
#
# Usage (from the repo root the SSM prelude cloned to):
#   infrastructure/vires_runner_spot_bootstrap.sh --job-id <workflow_job.id>
#
# REQUIRED SSM: /vires/runner/github_pat — fine-grained PAT,
#   owner=nousergon, repo=vires, Administration: Read and write
#   (REQUIRED to mint a JIT runner config, config#2653 — same scope the old
#   registration-token mint needed; the `Actions` permission alone does NOT
#   cover this, a common gotcha) + Contents: read (checkout).
#   THIS IS A DEDICATED, NARROWLY-SCOPED PAT — deliberately NOT a reuse of
#   SATURDAY_SF_WATCH_PAT, because Administration:write on a repo is a much
#   more sensitive grant (it can register/remove runners and rotate repo
#   settings) than that PAT's existing Contents/PRs/Issues/Actions scopes;
#   keeping it separate keeps the blast radius of a leak contained to "can
#   register a runner", not "can also merge PRs across the whole org".
# REQUIRED AWS: instance profile vires-runner-executor-profile
#   (infrastructure/iam/vires-runner-executor-role-{trust,policy}.json) —
#   read-only access to the one SSM param above. Nothing else: every AWS
#   credential the actual CI steps need (S3 sync, OIDC role assumption, etc.)
#   continues to flow through GitHub's own per-workflow OIDC mechanism
#   (`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`), completely independent of this
#   instance's own IAM role — self-hosted runners support that unchanged.

# NOTE ON WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT FIX (config#2653 comment, verified

# parameter, so this call does not (and per the public API cannot) bind the
# resulting runner to the SPECIFIC queued job that caused its own dispatch.
# Job-to-runner assignment for matching labels is still GitHub Actions'
# ordinary scheduler, unchanged by JIT vs. registration-token. What JIT DOES
# fix: the OLD flow was a full extra network round-trip (mint token, THEN
# config.sh does its own separate registration handshake) during which this
# runner was registered-but-not-yet-ready, widening the window another
# concurrently-registering runner could grab this job's slot first. JIT
# collapses that into one mint call with no separate handshake, shrinking
# (not eliminating) the race window. The failure mode where a queued job is
# never serviced at all (GitHub sends its `queued` webhook exactly once, so
# a dropped/misassigned job has no automatic retry) is NOT closed by this
# change — that needs a reconciliation/orphan-sweep on the dispatcher side,
# filed separately (do not conflate the two: this script only ever affects
# ITS OWN registration, it cannot detect or recover an orphaned job).
